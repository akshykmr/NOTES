BOX MODEL IN CSS 
M : margin
B  :  border 
P  :  padding
C  :  content

.container{
margin : 2px;
border: 3px solid red;
padding : 4px;
} 
height = conent + padding + border + margin ( top+ right+bottom+left)
total height =  content + 4px + 4px + 3px + 3px + 2px + 2px
padding margin and border are calculated of top and bottom for height and similarly left right for width
padding : 0 0 0 0; ( top right buttom left ) clock wise similary for margin 
padding : 0 0; ( top-bottom left-right) 
padding : 0; ( top bottom left right = equallly ) 

BORDER-STYLE
border-width : 1px;
border-style : solid;
border-color : green;
border : 1px solid rgba( 0,0,0,0.1) { rgba ( red,green,blue, opacitiy) } : shortcut to use all above prop
border-radius : 3px; :  used to give radius to a border equally 


MARGIN-COLLAPES : 
.box1{
margin : 10px;
}
box2{
margin : 20px;
}
When two element are rendered on a webpage in a vertical manner and have given their margin then the margin that collapes ( box1-bottom COLLAPES WITH box2-top ) is set to be common which is  greater from both  means in above written  case for box1 and box2 the common margin is set to be 20px for above boxes because it is greater than 10px; 


BOX - SIZING 
.box1{
width : 100px;
}
box2{
width : 100%;
padding: 2px;
border: 3px solid greay;
box-sizing: content-box or border-box;;
}
box-sizing include only border and padding to set the box size not marging included

box-sizing: content-box = it allow to overflow the box2 which is a child container over the parent element that is box 1  ( padding and border is not included ) 
box-sizing: border-box =  it help to not overflow the box 2 with box 1, means it fitted with box 1 : to fit the child container inside parent container  ( padding and border is included ) 


DISPLAY 

their is two level of element in html : 
block level 
and inline level
display : inline, block, 
INLINE : takes fixed or requires space by element, cant set width/height/ (margin): left-right margin  allowed top bottom not works), It allows other element to display before of after 

BLOCK : have full vw ( view point width ) contains full width horizontally or contain full row width new element can only be displayed in new line 

INLINE-BLOCK: similary with inline but width/height/margin/padding can be set for element 

display:none = element is removed from dom 
display : hidden = element is hidden but not removed width and height is reserved 


DIV:  IS A BLOCK ELEMENT BY DEFAULT AND ALSO ALL ELEMENT ARE BLOCK BY DEFUALT 
SPAN : is inline element by defualt 

ALL ELEMENTS ARE IN HTML IS A BLOCK ELEMENT BY DEFAULT


TEXT 
text-align: start, end, left, right, center, justify;
( only work on text content  not works on div , like paragraph heading etc it help to align text left right or center or justify ) 
text-decoration: underline, dottedline , etc; ( it helps to decorates the text with line  )
text-transform: uppercase , lowercase, sentencecase, Capitalize , etc; (  it help to change the case of text ) 

LINE-HEIGHT
line-height: 2px; ( it helps to give the gap between lines) 


FONTS
font-size: 12px; : help to manage the font size
font-family: ubuntu, 'Courier New', courier, monospace; : it will select any one family from given families
and google font also can be used for  the same
font-style: italic, etc
font-vairant
font-weight


Note: while using inline-block prop for two element given width 50% to each, a problem occures that there is a little space created between them to remove that space dont write div in next line write the next div just after the first div ends in html


SIZE-UNITS

font-size: 2px, 2em, 2rem, 2vh, 2vw,

em : relative to parent font size ( 2em means 2* parent font size) 
rem:  related to html predefined font size or root font size 
vh: relative to viewport height  ( 1vh : 1% of view port height ) 
vw:  relative to viewport width ( 1vw : 1% of view port width) 
% : relative to parent element ( 1% : 1% of parent element size) 

min-width/height: minimum width /height is fixed cant exceed after min limit 
max-width / height : max  width /height is fixed cant exceed after max limit



POSITIONING  : by default every element is statically setted( position:static)by default

used to manipulate the location of element over screen 

position : static; ( element is set with flow of html structure, not allows changes in  postion : top/bottom/left/right values will not work ) 
position : relative  ( allow changes in  postion : top/bottom/left/right values will work here and if not top/left...... values are not given then it behave like static   ) 
position : absolute ( element is removed from flow of structure and its position is relative or obey to its first non-static ( parent element should be positioned : relative )  ancestor ( parent of parents of parent div :  ) allow changes in positon)
position : fixed  (  similar with absolute,  relative to  browser window postion is fixed while scroll and allow changes in postion  ) 
position : sticky  ( it is used to make nav bar sticky ) 
z-index: 1 ( the element that has max value of z index will appear on above while overflow or overlaping ) or specify the stack order of a element 

A DIV CAN BE SET IN CENTER BY GIVEN BELOW CODE 
margin: auto; ( it will set margin automatically in left and right side ) 

list-style: square inside url('men.jpg') ( type, positon, image) : used in ul or li to specify the type of style
here position tell us that bullet point will appear inside the ul div or outside of ul div 






Alt + z to wrap text in vs code : used in lorem 34

m0 is shortcut for marging :0; and similar p0 is for padding and m0+p0 can be used for margin and padding 
css properties are key value pair like margin : 10px; where margin is key and value is 10px


css style formate
to create multiple list in html then type : "li * 4" for four list items
